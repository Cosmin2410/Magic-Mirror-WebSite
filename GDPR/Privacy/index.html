      <h1>GDPR & Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        lipsum.com is committed to protecting your privacy online. This Privacy
        Policy endeavours to describe to you our practices regarding the
        personal information we collect from users on our website, located at
        lipsum.com (the “Site”), and the services offered through the Site. If
        you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, our collection
        practices, the processing of user information, or if you would like to
        report a security violation to us directly, please contact us at
        help@lipsum.com
      </p>

      <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        General Data: The use of our services will automatically create
        information that will be collected. For example, when you use our
        Services, your geographic location, how you use the Services,
        information about the type of device you use, your Open Device
        Identification Number, date/time stamps for your visit, your unique
        device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet
        Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This
        information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant
        information to you and administer and improve the Site.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Log Files: As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
        automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP
        addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
        pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use
        this information to maintain and improve the performance of the
        Services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Analytics: We use analytics services (including, but not limited to,
        Google Analytics) to help analyze how users use the Site. Analytics
        services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users
        visit the Site and we use the information to improve our Site and
        Services. The analytics services' ability to use and share information
        collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy
        policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these
        entities use this information.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Location Information: If you have enabled location services on your
        mobile device, we may collect your location information to improve the
        Services we offer. If you do not want this information collected, you
        can disable location services on your device.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cookies: “Cookies” are small pieces of information (text files) that a
        website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the
        website. These text files can be used by websites to make the users
        experience more efficient. The law states that we can store these
        cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation
        of this site. For all other types of cookies we need your permission. To
        that end, this site uses different types of cookies. Some cookies are
        placed by third party services that appear on our pages. We and some
        third parties may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close
        your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer
        until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and
        interactive experience on our Services and to market the Services or
        other products. Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across
        websites. The intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging
        for the individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and
        third party advertisers. This tracking is done on an anonymous basis
        and, while not an exhaustive list, some of the companies we work with
        are Google, AppNexus
